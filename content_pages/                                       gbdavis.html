          <h1>George Berry Davis</h1>
          <p>Born March 12, 1837 in Indiana, George Berry Davis served as a private in Company F of the 4th Regiment in the Iowa Infantry in the American Civil War. As revealed in many letters that he wrote to his wife Catharine from the fields and camps, Davis experienced a number of battles, hardships, and injuries. Perhaps the most significant aspect of his time of service, however, was when he was captured and sent to the infamous Andersonville prison.</p>
