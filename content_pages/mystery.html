The Mystery of the Spanish Document
<br/>
<br/>

1622 A.D.
<br/><br/>
 
Pedro de la Farxa was a Frenchman who emigrated to the spanish city of Seville. He was considered one of the top merchants in Spain. The document which bears his name is addressed to his wife Antonia de Antinaque and his children and appears to be his last will and testament. Because of the condition of the document it is extremely difficult to examine it more closely. Adding to the mystery surrounding this document are the unknown circumstances which led to its acquisition by the CSUB archives.
